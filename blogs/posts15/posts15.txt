The past few days I've continued working on the stock market project. On Friday and Saturday I experimented with LSTM and convolutional layers in the neural network to see how they fared. They were both much slower than a densely connected network, even on my GPU. LSTM networks showed some promise, however, I had difficulty training 5-10 layer networks as the loss wasn't decreasing. Today, I set up a stock market simulation to project results. So far, it succeeded in making a small amount of simulated money. The real test will happen tonight when I simulate a whole month. As this will take 10+ hours, I'm leaving it run overnight. Lets hope that in the future it could be used to actually buy/sell on a brokerage.
