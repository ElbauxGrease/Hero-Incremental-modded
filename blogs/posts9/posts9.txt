I continued working on the user signup/login page I started a week or so ago. This time, I added a place for users to add details about themselves, including a picture they can identify by. I started by creating a form data object, and adding the (binary) picture along with the other details. This worked best on the JavaScript side, but when it came to parsing the form data with python I had a fit. I had to write a custom parser to get the various names/contents of the parameters (picture: binary, token: token..) from the multipart form. After adding several! built in python libraries, I found myself in a crux where I couldn't convert the binary to base64. It turned out to be a client-side problem, and after I realized I could convert the binary using JavaScript's FileReader, I simply sent the data as JSON rather than using my form data parser. With the help of the Python Image Library, users on this sign up page can now add a thumbnail of themselves.
