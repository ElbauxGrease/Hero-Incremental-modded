Today's project was a difficult one. It is unfinished for reasons still unclear. I used openCV to draw xyz axes on a plane. At first, this involved the use of cv.projectPoints(), which gave 2d coordinates for 3d points. This function proved to be junk, and instead I found how it worked and implemented the function on my own. It simply multiplies a rotation matrix by a vector, in my case the vector was a unit vector on each coordinate axis. This product gives the point in [x, y, z] format. Plotting only x and y will project the point onto the xy-plane. Next, I opened a socket between my laptop and raspberry pi. The socket allowed me to send data from the pi's gyroscope to the laptop over my network. </div><br><div>With roll, pitch, and yaw data, I attempted to project these angles to the coordinate axes. This part gave me big trouble for an unknown reason. The axes weren't continuous when the angles changed from 2*pi to 0. To fix this, I added a factor of 2*pi when going from 360->0deg, and subtracted it when going from 0->360deg. My other problem was the pitch data affecting yaw data. Around a pitch of 90deg, the yaw will change by 180deg. I found this due to tilt compensation not working correctly. None the less, I managed to capture an image of me rotating the different axes. You'll see the final axis, the roll, isn't rotating correctly because of the yaw changing as well.
