While you can't accurately predict the stock market because of too many outside variables, there are other methods in quantitative analysis such as using moving average. I'll continue looking into that, though short selling the market doesn't seem lucrative this way because it trades on the scale of hundreds of days.

Fluid dynamics has interested me for a while and is something I wanted to study. It's a common application of differential equations. I finally found a decent project I could do involving air currents around an airfoil. <a href="https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython">Using lesson 10 from this repository</a>, I consolidated the majority of the code into a single file. I changed the angle of attack and found that the AOA of the freestream changed faster than the inputted angle. Simple hack, since it seemed to grow at a rate of 4:1. My only major complaint is that streams can go through the object. I made a gif, rotating the stream and then the image to make it look like the airfoil was rotating. It should give some insight into how planes experience lift by changing the wing's AOA.
