A friend wanted to work on a project together. His idea was a basketball game written in JavaScript/HTML5 using the canvas element. We started working on it last night, and today it came into fruition. I had some prior experience using the canvas element from a <a href="/chain-physics/canvas.html">chain physics demo</a> a couple years ago which I pulled from my GitHub to use as a template. The game is simple, a basketball is suspended in the air and dragging and dropping the mouse in one direction will send the basketball flying in the other. I added a hoop and some code to make the ball bounce off the rim. Then a score counter. You can play it <a href='/hoops-game/hoops.html'>here</a>. Since that and my pendulum project were both pretty quick, I managed to finish both today. I found a package called muniverse which uses reinforcement learning to "teach" an AI to play HTML5 games. If I can get around to downloading it and the dependencies (ffmpeg gave me trouble last night installing OpenAI's gym), then I will see if it can learn to score points. The only problem I foresee is dragging and dropping, which I'm unsure if muniverse currently supports.
