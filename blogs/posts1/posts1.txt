		I created the basic layout of this website, though I'm not sure I like it. It has many placeholders
		and is based somewhat on the blog layout provided by w3schools. It will do for now, though I foresee
		many updates to the styling in the future.

		Okay, let's go over my most recent pursuits. I have a journal that's been filling up with problem solutions
		from the book The New Turing Omnibus by A.K. Dewdney. This book is an excellent expedition into hard computer
		science. It covers many topics in its 66 chapters, stressing heavily algorithms, time complexity, and automata. It is a little dated,
		written in 1993, and thus covering old topics such as Disk Operating Systems. However, it is impressive in that 
		it covers machine learning. This is not a textbook and is riddled with mistakes, however, I have used it to write
		my first neural network months ago.

		I also followed a YouTube course by Steve Brunton (University of Washington, dept of EE) which was a so-called 
		Control Theory bootcamp. Control Theory is a 3rd year course in Electrical Engineering dealing with open and 
		closed loop systems which may be controlled through the use of actuators. I took notes and coded up a few examples
		which can be found on my GitHub. One was an Inverted Pendulum on a cart, where the cart solved the problem of keeping
		a pendulum upright. I used Python, whereas Steve used MatLab. One challenge I faced was needing a graphics library.
		I found graphics.py online and used it to draw a simple cart-pendulum system. Overall, this class taught me a 
		significant amount about solving linear control systems and techniques used in the field.

		Outside of EE/CS I studied a little bit of Biochemistry, but found it rather tedious to self-study the many amino acids
		for very little gain. I can't program a set of biochemical reactions and see results. However, I find this subject 
		important to understanding the foundations of life itself. I applied to Ohio State University and got accepted into the
		Biochemistry program before deciding not to go. There's more for me in the Electrical Engineering department.
