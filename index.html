				This is a new blog that will feature what I've been doing and working on recently.

				In the past and in my freetime I worked on physics simulations, arduino games, machine learning algorithms, and a 
				slew of other things. I want to continue working on projects and educating myself in programming and electronics, 
				and this is where I will post about it.

				Some of my projects are linked on my GitHub. They range from Python to HTML5, even including FORTRAN 
				code. Not uploaded are projects in machine learning algorithms with Rietman-Frye networks and 2D Classifiers. I also fiddle with a 10DOF gyroscope/accelerometer
				sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi.

				I am a graduate of New Philadelphia High School, Class of 2014. I attended Ohio University for 2.5 years
				where I studied Physics. While there, I worked as a Student Software Developer for OHIO Information Technologies.
				Since then, I've studied independently and kept an interest in all manner of geeky things.
